# StringEmojiExtension_swift
An extension on String that can find all ranges of emojis in a string.

For an Objective-C version see https://github.com/berlininsomniac/NSStringEmojiCategory

Originally developed for the Wavy app (https://wavy-app.com) to increase the font size for messages that contained only emojis.

The category allows for single-method checking wether the string contains only emojis, offers ways to find the ranges within an NSString that consist solely of emojis and allows to strip emojis from a string.

Used this list when creating it: http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/1.0//emoji-data.txt

Enjoy.
